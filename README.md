add folders before it can work:
- cam0
- cam1
- staging_images

also add a config.yml file with db connection string, or else microsoft goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

if running outside docker container:
- add ffmpeg folder, and add to PATH

running this code outside of a docker container is silly, don't do it. then again, who am I to tell you what to do..
